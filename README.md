## Description

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle.
This small project implements a playable version of the game and comes with a simple GUI.
It aims to show basic knowledge about Python and GUI design.
Thanks to itâ€™s simplicity of use and because performance is not imperative for this project,
Pygame was selected to provide the user interface.
